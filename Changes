1.114 2021-12-11T01:57:39Z
	* Make Lingua::JA::Romanize::Japanese optional since it tries to
	download data files that have disappeared. I have a patched version
	at https://github.com/briandfoy/lingua-ja-romanize-japanese that
	fixes the issues.

1.111_01 2016-06-07T21:58:53Z
	* Be careful about loading Lingua::JA::Romanize::Japanese in hantest

	a compilation error.

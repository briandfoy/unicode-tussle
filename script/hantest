    Due to its status as a prestige dialect, it often called "Standard Cantonese" (simplified Chinese: 标准粤语; traditional Chinese: 標準粵語; Jyutping: biu1zeon2 jyut6jyu5; Guangdong Romanization：Biu1 zên2 yud6 yu5).

    Chinese has a word 青 (qīng) that can refer to both, though it also has
    separate words for blue (蓝 / 藍, lán) and green (绿 / 綠, lǜ).

    The modern Chinese language has the blue-green distinction (蓝/ 藍
    lán for blue and 绿 / 緑 lǜ for green); however, another word which
    predates the modern vernacular, qīng (Chinese: 青), is also used. It
    can refer to either blue or green, or even (though much less
    frequently) to black, as in xuánqīng (Chinese: 玄青 where Chinese: 玄
    refers to black). For example, the Flag of the Republic of China is
    today still referred to as qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng ("Blue
    Sky, White Sun, Whole Ground Red" — Chinese: 青天，白日，满地红);
    whereas qīng cài (Chinese: 青菜) is the Chinese word for "green
    vegetable". Qīng 青 was the traditional designation of both blue and
    green for much of the history of the Chinese language, while 蓝 lán
    and 绿 lǜ were introduced relatively more recently, as a part of the
    adoption of modern Vernacular Chinese as the social norm, replacing
    Classical Chinese.

    The Chinese version is simply, 妈妈给我们的钱,我已经买了糖了. Māma gěi wǒmen de qián, wǒ yǐjīng mǎile táng le. This is translated somewhat directly as, "The money Mom gave us, I already bought candy," lacking a preface as in English.

    Another major difference between the syntax of Chinese and languages like English lies in the stacking order of modifying clauses. 昨天发脾气的外交警察取消了沒有交钱的那些人的入境证. Zuótiān fāpíqì de wàijiāo jǐngchá qǔxiāole méiyǒu jiāoqián de nàxiē rén de rùjìngzhèng. Using the Chinese order in English, that sentence would be [blah blah blah].

    Tones http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_phonology#Tones

    Guangzhou Cantonese has seven tones, but Hong Kong Cantonese has six with
    the high-falling tone merging with the high tone. Although it is often said
    to have nine or eleven, the additional tones added in the counts are
    entering tones. In Chinese, the number of possible tones depends on the
    syllable type. There are six contour tones in syllables that end in a vowel
    or nasal consonant. (Some of these have more than one realization, but such
    differences are seldom used to distinguish words.) In syllables that end in
    a stop consonant, the number of tones is reduced to three; in Chinese
    descriptions, these "entering tones" are treated separately, so that
    Cantonese is traditionally said to have nine tones. However, phonetically
    these are a conflation of tone and syllable type; the number of phonemic
    tones is six in Hong Kong and seven in Guangzhou.

For purposes of meters in Chinese poetry, the first and fourth tones are the "level tones" (平聲), while the rest are the "oblique tones" (仄聲).

The first tone can be either high level or high falling usually without affecting the meaning of the words being spoken. Most speakers are in general not consciously aware of when they use and when to use high level and high falling. In Hong Kong, most speakers have merged the high and high falling tones. In Guangzhou, the high falling tone is disappearing as well, but is still prevalent among certain words (saam-high falling means the number three, where saam-high means shirt).

The numbers "394052786" when pronounced in Cantonese, will give the nine tones in order (Romanisation (Yale) saam1, gau2, sei3, ling4, ng5, yi6, chat7, baat8, luk9), thus giving a good mnemonic for remembering the nine tones.

    The Korean word 푸르다 (pureuda) can mean either green or blue.

    The native Korean word 푸르다 (Revised Romanization: pureu-da adj.) may
    mean either blue or green, or bluish green. This word 푸르다 is used as
    in 푸른 하늘 (pureun haneul, blue sky) for blue or as in 푸른 숲 (pureun
    sup, green forest) for green. Distinct words for blue and green are
    also used; 파란 (paran adj.), 파란색/파랑 (paransaek/parang n.) for blue,
    초록 (chorok adj./n.), 초록색 (choroksaek n. or for short, 녹색 noksaek n.)
    for green. However, in the case of a traffic light, paran is used
    for the green light meaning go, even though the word is typically
    used to mean blue. Cheong 청 is also used for both blue and green. It
    is a loan from Chinese (靑, pinyin: qing) and is used in the proper
    name Cheong Wa Dae (청와대 or Hanja: 靑瓦臺), the Blue House, which is the
    executive office and official residence of the President of the
    Republic of Korea.

    Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, "Eastern Capital"), officially Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to),is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. It is located on the eastern side of the main island Honshū and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).

    Kyoto (京都 Kyōto) (Japanese pronunciation: [kʲoːto]) is a city in the central part of the island of Honshū, Japan.

    The Japanese language is written with a combination of three scripts: Chinese characters called kanji (漢字), and two syllabic scripts made up of modified Chinese characters, hiragana (ひらがな or 平仮名) and katakana (カタカナ or 片仮名). The Latin alphabet, rōmaji (ローマ字), is also often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and logos, advertising, and when entering Japanese text into a computer.

The main distinction in Japanese accents is
between Tokyo-type 	(東京式 	Tōkyō-shiki?)
and Kyoto-Osaka-type 	(京阪式 	Keihan-shiki?),
though Kyūshū-type dialects form a third, smaller group.

    In Japanese, the word for blue (青 ao) is often used for colors that
    English speakers would refer to as green, such as the color of a
    traffic signal meaning "go".

    The Japanese word ao (青, n., aoi (青い, adj.)), exactly the same
    kanji character as the Chinese qīng above, can refer to either blue
    or green depending on the situation. Modern Japanese has also
    adopted the Chinese word for green (緑 midori), although this was
    not always so. Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the
    word midori only came into use in the Heian period, and at that time
    (and for a long time thereafter) midori was still considered a shade
    of ao. Educational materials distinguishing green and blue only came
    into use after World War II, during the Occupation[citation needed]:
    thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green, the word
    ao is still used to describe certain vegetables, apples and
    vegetation. Ao is also the name for the color of a traffic light,
    which is bluer than in English-speaking countries. However, most
    other objects—a green car, a green sweater, and so forth—will
    generally be called midori. Japanese people also sometimes use the
    word guriin (グリーン), based on the English word "green", for colors.
    The language also has several other words meaning specific shades of
    green and blue.

春曉 孟浩然	Ceon1 Hiu2 Maang6 Hou6jin4

Due to its status as a prestige dialect, it often called "Standard
Cantonese" (simplified Chinese: 标准粤语; traditional Chinese: 標準粵語;
Jyutping: biu1zeon2 jyut6jyu5; Guangdong Romanization：Biu1 zên2 yud6
yu5).

Chinese has a word 青 (qīng) that can refer to both, though it also has
separate words for blue (蓝 / 藍, lán) and green (绿 / 綠, lǜ).

The modern Chinese language has the blue-green distinction (蓝/ 藍 lán
for blue and 绿 / 緑 lǜ for green); however, another word which predates
the modern vernacular, qīng (Chinese: 青), is also used. It can refer to
either blue or green, or even (though much less frequently) to black, as
in xuánqīng (Chinese: 玄青 where Chinese: 玄 refers to black). For
example, the Flag of the Republic of China is today still referred to as
qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng ("Blue Sky, White Sun, Whole Ground Red"
— Chinese: 青天，白日，满地红); whereas qīng cài (Chinese: 青菜) is the
Chinese word for "green vegetable". Qīng 青 was the traditional
designation of both blue and green for much of the history of the
Chinese language, while 蓝 lán and 绿 lǜ were introduced relatively more
recently, as a part of the adoption of modern Vernacular Chinese as the
social norm, replacing Classical Chinese.

The Chinese version is simply, 妈妈给我们的钱,我已经买了糖了. Māma gěi
wǒmen de qián, wǒ yǐjīng mǎile táng le. This is translated somewhat
directly as, "The money Mom gave us, I already bought candy," lacking a
preface as in English.

Another major difference between the syntax of Chinese and languages
like English lies in the stacking order of modifying clauses. 昨天发脾气
的外交警察取消了沒有交钱的那些人的入境证. Zuótiān fāpíqì de wàijiāo
jǐngchá qǔxiāole méiyǒu jiāoqián de nàxiē rén de rùjìngzhèng. Using the
Chinese order in English, that sentence would be [blah blah blah].

Tones http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_phonology#Tones

Guangzhou Cantonese has seven tones, but Hong Kong Cantonese has six
with the high-falling tone merging with the high tone. Although it is
often said to have nine or eleven, the additional tones added in the
counts are entering tones. In Chinese, the number of possible tones
depends on the syllable type. There are six contour tones in syllables
that end in a vowel or nasal consonant. (Some of these have more than
one realization, but such differences are seldom used to distinguish
words.) In syllables that end in a stop consonant, the number of tones
is reduced to three; in Chinese descriptions, these "entering tones" are
treated separately, so that Cantonese is traditionally said to have nine
tones. However, phonetically these are a conflation of tone and syllable
type; the number of phonemic tones is six in Hong Kong and seven in
Guangzhou.

For purposes of meters in Chinese poetry, the first and fourth tones are
the "level tones" (平聲), while the rest are the "oblique tones" (仄聲).

The first tone can be either high level or high falling usually without
affecting the meaning of the words being spoken. Most speakers are in
general not consciously aware of when they use and when to use high
level and high falling. In Hong Kong, most speakers have merged the high
and high falling tones. In Guangzhou, the high falling tone is
disappearing as well, but is still prevalent among certain words (saam-
high falling means the number three, where saam-high means shirt).

The numbers "394052786" when pronounced in Cantonese, will give the nine
tones in order (Romanisation (Yale) saam1, gau2, sei3, ling4, ng5, yi6,
chat7, baat8, luk9), thus giving a good mnemonic for remembering the
nine tones.

====KOREAN====

The Korean word 푸르다 (pureuda) can mean either green or blue.

The native Korean word 푸르다 (Revised Romanization: pureu-da adj.) may
mean either blue or green, or bluish green. This word 푸르다 is used as
in 푸른 하늘 (pureun haneul, blue sky) for blue or as in 푸른 숲 (pureun
sup, green forest) for green. Distinct words for blue and green are also
used; 파란 (paran adj.), 파란색/파랑 (paransaek/parang n.) for blue,
초록 (chorok adj./n.), 초록색 (choroksaek n. or for short, 녹색 noksaek
n.) for green. However, in the case of a traffic light, paran is used
for the green light meaning go, even though the word is typically used
to mean blue. Cheong 청 is also used for both blue and green. It is a
loan from Chinese (靑, pinyin: qing) and is used in the proper name
Cheong Wa Dae (청와대 or Hanja: 靑瓦臺), the Blue House, which is the
executive office and official residence of the President of the Republic
of Korea.

====JAPANESE====



The Japanese language is written with a combination of three scripts:
Chinese characters called kanji (漢字), and two syllabic scripts made up
of modified Chinese characters, hiragana (ひらがな or 平仮名) and
katakana (カタカナ or 片仮名). The Latin alphabet, rōmaji (ローマ字), is
also often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and
logos, advertising, and when entering Japanese text into a computer.

The main distinction in Japanese accents is between Tokyo-type 	(東京式
Tōkyō-shiki?) and Kyoto-Osaka-type 	(京阪式 	Keihan-shiki?),
though Kyūshū-type dialects form a third, smaller group.

In Japanese, the word for blue (青 ao) is often used for colors that
English speakers would refer to as green, such as the color of a traffic
signal meaning "go".

The Japanese word ao (青, n., aoi (青い, adj.)), exactly the same kanji
character as the Chinese qīng above, can refer to either blue or green
depending on the situation. Modern Japanese has also adopted the Chinese
word for green (緑 midori), although this was not always so. Ancient
Japanese did not have this distinction: the word midori only came into
use in the Heian period, and at that time (and for a long time
thereafter) midori was still considered a shade of ao. Educational
materials distinguishing green and blue only came into use after World
War II, during the Occupation[citation needed]: thus, even though most
Japanese consider them to be green, the word ao is still used to
describe certain vegetables, apples and vegetation. Ao is also the name
for the color of a traffic light, which is bluer than in English-
speaking countries. However, most other objects—a green car, a green
sweater, and so forth—will generally be called midori. Japanese people
also sometimes use the word guriin (グリーン), based on the English word
"green", for colors. The language also has several other words meaning
specific shades of green and blue.
